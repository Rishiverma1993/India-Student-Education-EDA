# K-means algorithm
The plots display firstly what a K-means algorithm would yield using three clusters. It is then shown what the effect of a bad initialization is on the classification process: By setting n_init to only 1 (default is 10), the amount of times that the algorithm will be run with different centroid seeds is reduced. The next plot displays what using eight clusters would deliver and finally the ground truth.
